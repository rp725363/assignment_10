1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
Ans:-
These two function are used to copy  file in python as as below.
shutil.copy() - this function used to a single file from source path to destination path while ,
uses are as below.
import shutil
shutil.copy("source_file_path","destination_file_path")

shutil.copytree() this funcction used for copy the the entire the directoy tree from the source path to destination path.
uses are as below:-
shutil.copytree("source_directory","destination_directory")


2. What function is used to rename files??
Ans:-
in python os.rename() basically used to rename a file name , this function takes two argument to change the name as below.

import os

os.rename("existine_file_name.txt","new_file_name.txt")

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
Ans:-
sendtotrash:- provide an easy way to to sending file and directories to recycle bin instead of permanantly delete.

shutil: The shutil module provides a function called shutil.rmtree() that can be used to delete a directory and its contents recursively. 
This function permanently deletes the files and directories that are passed to it, without sending them to the trash or recycle bin. 
This means that the deleted files and directories cannot be recovered using the standard file recovery mechanisms provided by the operating system.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
Ans:-
As open() used to open a file or direcoty here are zipfile constructer also used for open a zipfile 
zipfile are used to creat a new objects that represents the zip archive file. constructor takes zip archive file as first argument and mode of opening same zip file as 
second argement.

import zipfile

# Open a ZIP archive file in read mode
with zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'r') as archive:
    # Do something with the archive
    pass
    
    
5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
Ans:-
Here is an python programm  that contains file format (.pdf and .jpeg) as below:-
import os
import shutil

# Set the source and destination folders
source_folder = 'path/to/source/folder'
destination_folder = 'path/to/destination/folder'

# Set the file extension to search for
file_extension = '.pdf'

# Walk through the source folder tree
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_folder):
    for file in files:
        # Check if the file has the desired extension
        if file.endswith(file_extension):
            # Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
            if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
                os.makedirs(destination_folder)
            
            # Construct the source and destination paths
            source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            destination_path = os.path.join(destination_folder, file)
            
            # Copy the file to the destination folder
            shutil.copy2(source_path, destination_path)
            
            # Print a message indicating the file was copied
            print(f"Copied '{file}' from '{source_path}' to '{destination_path}'")
